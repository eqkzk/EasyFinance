SBUX,Starbucks CEO gives a nod to barista labor push: ‘We always listen to our partners',"Starbucks' CEO Kevin Johnson is keeping a close eye on unionization efforts made by a growing number of the coffee giant's store workers.

The small segment of cafe employees, which Starbucks calls ""partners,"" have been making big waves recently after two Buffalo, N.Y.-based stores led an organized labor push. With stores in other cities poised to have votes of their own, Johnson emphasized there are only ""two company-operated stores that are certified unions"" so far.",Finance,"Starbucks' CEO Kevin Johnson is keeping a close eye on unionization efforts made by a growing number of the coffee giant's store workers. The small segment of cafe employees, which Starbucks calls ""partners,"" have been making big waves recently after two Buffalo, N.Y.-based stores led an organized labor push. With stores in other cities poised to have votes of their own, Johnson emphasized there are only ""two company-operated stores that are certified unions"" so far. n the phone call, Kevin Johnson did acknowledge the unions are not completely new to the coffee chain, but the company has experience with its channel-licensed partners. 

""We have a few thousand stores in our channel-licensed partners, like many of the big grocery channels...that have a Starbucks within their grocery store that are unionized, so we've got experience with our licensed partners on how they run unionized stores,"" he added.

U.S. partners include stores like Kroger (KR), Target (TGT), Safeway and Albertsons (ACI). Johnson emphasized that the labor push is not making on a difference on how his business operates. 

Starbucks has poured $1 billion of investment into boosting wages for workers. This announcement meant that the average pay for all Starbucks' U.S. hourly partners is nearly $17 per an hour, with average hourly rates ranging between $15 to $23. 
All of which raises a fear that higher pay may start to take a toll on the bottom line, a risk Wall Street analysts have cited in an environment of increasing wage inflation.
""We had some of the investments started in October...we had another wage increase in January, we got some more coming this summer, so at the end of the day, we always listen to our partners, we always will, whether they're a union store or not,"" Johnson insisted.

In a phone interview with Yahoo Finance after Starbucks' fiscal first-quarter earnings results, he weighed in on the movement, which has now spread to 54 stores across 19 states. This comes only weeks after the after one Buffalo store voted to create the coffee giant's first ever union back in December, and three more Buffalo stores are holding votes on February 23rd. 

""There's roughly 50...that have filed petitions to the NLRB [National Labor Relations Board] to go through the process to see if partners in those stores want to vote for a union,"" Johnson said. ""Those have not occurred yet and I think that's an important thing just to point out,"" he added.

The company has publicly resisted the efforts, but vowed to work to address worker concerns. The dozens of stores pushing for a union vote, however, are a small fraction of the 9,900 locations run by Starbucks in North America alone. 

For those locations where employees do vote to unionize, Johnson says they are following the protocols to have this change rollover smoothly, ""We're following the NLRB process and we respect that process and we'll continue to do that,"" he told Yahoo Finance.

PayPal shares plunged about 25% to $133 in afternoon trading as the company reported a mixed end to the fourth quarter and soft outlook for 2022. 
Total payment volume rose 23% in the fourth quarter, slowing from a 33% growth pace for all of 2021. Non-GAAP operating margins fell 291 basis points from a year ago.
""For the quarter, our guidance contemplated generating about 12.9 million net new actives [accounts] on an organic basis. We had a slower-than-expected finish to the year and came in below our target,"" PayPal CFO John Rainey said on a Tuesday evening earnings call.
PayPal added 9.8 million net new active accounts in the fourth quarter. Rainey pinned the shortfall on several factors. 
""First, the more muted into the year for e-commerce growth driven by both supply chain challenges, as well as pullback in spending by lower-income consumers affected consumer growth. Second, in the back half of the quarter, we also changed course on some of our customer acquisition strategies, including incentive-led campaigns. And lastly and most impactful to the quarter, there were certain accounts that we disqualified or excluded from our net new active number.,"" Rainey added.
Here is how PayPal performed compared to Wall Street estimates:
Net Sales: $6.92 billion vs. $6.89 billion
Adjusted Operating Margin: 21.8% vs. 23%
Adjusted Diluted EPS: $1.11 vs. $1.12
For the full year, PayPal said it sees earnings of $4.60 to $4.75 a share. Wall Street analysts had estimated $5.23.
Analysts were also disappointed on the outlook for new accounts.
""PayPal now expects only ~15-20 million net account adds in FY22 vs. our 55-60 million expectation with a return to pre-pandemic trends of ~30-40m per year thereafter. This net account guidance is about half of its previous guidance set on its February 2021 analyst day through 2025 with PayPal turning its focus to higher engaged accounts and raising average revenue per user,"" explained Deutsche Bank analyst Bryan Keane.
Keane left his Buy rating on PayPal intact but slashed the price target on the stock to $200 from $260. ","the market is rerating the one-time growth juggernaut that is payment giant paypal (pypl).
